Delroy,

- Good job in creating your accounts!

- Good job in setting up your java compiler in "your system"?

- Good job with your first GitHub submission!

- Good organization of your repository! :)

However,

- The evidence of setting up the java compiler (javac) in your system is
  suspicious. It says it was installed in "Donna"'s system.

- Please be careful in following instructions in the future.

- A little header or cover page with your name, class, assignment, date, etc.
  is always good to have in any assignment of this type.

- Please staple all your assignments as necessary.


Peace,

- Dr. Pablo Rivas
